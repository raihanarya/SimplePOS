*This POS is personalized for a coffee shop; however any business with inventory also suitable for this system. Developed using PHP for local used only.*

Project background:
* Cheapest comerliazed POS system out there is $10 per month; $120 annually solely for record-keeping.
* Small business shouldn't be making P/L report MANUALLY.

Of course, this project is FAR from full-feature. So I'll be adding more in the near future. Feel free to contribute and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
